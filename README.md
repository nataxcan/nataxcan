# Hey there
I'm Nathan Axcan, Comp Sci student @ TU Delft

## 📚
In order to learn fast I do a lot of things like:
- startup analysis ([Plug&Play Tech Center](https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/))
- messing around in python ([NLP](https://simpletransformers.ai/), chatbots, transformer networks and other fun stuff)
- data science ([Cortexter](https://www.cortexter.com/))
- podcasting about motivation and productivity ([Slim Radio](http://slimradio.nl/category/monday-morning-motivation/))
- research on EdTech solutions ([holograms! for TU Delft](https://www.educationandlearning.nl/news/holograms-for-learning))
- strategic advising (startups, projects)
- dream analysis ([a few friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Interpretation_of_Dreams))

And I also love to talk about interesting code, opportunities, ideas!
Love cars in artistic, technical, and innovative lenses.
Love technology in general actually.
