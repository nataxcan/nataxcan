# Hey there
I'm Nathan Axcan, Comp Sci student @ TU Delft

In order to learn fast I do a lot of things like:
- startup analysis (Plug&Play Tech Center)
- messing around in python (NLP and other fun stuff)
- data science ([Cortexter](https://www.cortexter.com/))
- podcasting about motivation and productivity (Slim Radio)
- strategic advising (startups, projects)
- dream analysis (a few friends)

And I also love to talk about interesting code, opportunities, ideas!

Shoot an email over at nathanaxcan@gmail.com and I'll be happy to hear what you have to say.
